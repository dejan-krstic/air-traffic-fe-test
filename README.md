## !important note: 
Master branch and [<b>GitHub Pages</b>](https://dejan-krstic.github.io/air-traffic-fe-test/) display the code written in 48 hours. After that time I continued my work on development branch and current changes are:
- webpack is completely rewritten, split into webpack.dev.js and webpack.prod.js with added functionalities
- folders are reorganized 
- using EJS templates for creating index.html 
- imported airplane image and favicon dynamically 
- installed BrowserSync and switched to SCSS since I plan to create better responsiveness for mobile devices
- ...responsiveness completed
- animated Details page

### Checkout the development branch:  
$ git clone https://github.com/dejan-krstic/air-traffic-fe-test.git -b development
## Development demo, uploaded on Netlify: [AIR TRAFFIC FE](https://air-traffic-fe.netlify.com/#flights)



# Air Traffic Front-End Test


Single Page Application, that displays data of all the airplanes that are flying over user's current location. Airplanes are sorted by current altitude and flight course orients icon in the list. User can navigate to details page, where more of the flight's data is provided alongside airline logo. 
 
App was created without frameworks in 48 hours as a test project applying for entry level Front-End position. Basic CSS transitions and effects are used to enhance UX and simple hash router for navigating through pages.
